## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Framework Validation Fails**
```bash
./tests/validate_framework.py
```
Check output for specific import or component failures.

**Performance Violations**
Adjust limits based on hardware capabilities:
```bash
./tests/test_end_to_end.py --hook-limit-ms 50 --memory-limit-mb 100
```

**Test Timeouts**
Reduce test intensity for slower systems:
```bash
./tests/test_end_to_end.py --concurrent-hooks 3 --stress-duration-s 10
```

**Import Errors**
Ensure all dependencies are available via uv:
```bash
uv pip install psutil cryptography typing-extensions
```

### Debug Mode
Enable verbose output for detailed debugging:
```bash
./tests/run_end_to_end_tests.py --verbose
```
